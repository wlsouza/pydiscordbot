This repository is a template that you can use to start your own discord bot.  
I made this template so that everyone can start their own bot already with a good structure, making it easy to maintain and scale.

### Features already implementeds:
<details open>
  <summary>
    <b>Management of bot modules</b>
  </summary>
  
  > This feature allows you to load or unload the bot's modules (or Cogs, as you prefer to call it), that is, the bot owner (and only him) can in a simple way, unload a module for **all guilds** that are using the bot.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Management of guild modules</b>
  </summary>

  > This feature allows the owner of the guild that is using the bot to activate or deactivate the modules that the guild can use.  
  >
  > **How use:**  
  To use it, just send ```$enable_modules``` or ```$disable_modules``` and an interface like the one presented in the functionality above will appear for you to select the modules to be enabled or disabled.  
  >
  >**Obs.** Unlike the previous one this feature does not affect everyone who is using the bot, it only affects the guild that executed the command.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>Command prefix change</b>
  </summary>

  > This feature allows the guild owner to select which prefix he will use when sending a command to the bot.  
  >
  > **How use:**  
  To use it, just send ```$change_prefix %``` replacing the ```%``` with whatever character you want to use as a command prefix in your guild.  
  >
  >**Obs.** This functionality only affects the guild that executed the command. 
  >
  >**Obs2.** After changing the prefix, the bot will no longer respond to commands starting with ```$``` (default prefix), and will only respond to commands using the prefix informed in the exchange. 
</details>
